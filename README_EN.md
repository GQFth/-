## Usage

The multimodal model of the CIFAR-10 training set, used for image recognition, has a simple model architecture, allowing you to quickly get started with machine learning.

## Why

When we are learning machine learning, we might feel at a loss as there are too many and overly complicated official documents, and many of the logical concepts are difficult to apply, which is not conducive to our learning. 
We should focus more on practice and less on theory. The purpose of this library is to start from the most basic model architecture, leaving only the core logic for everyone to study.

## How

Based on the functional points of each function, they are gradually broken down one by one.

### Tasking

#### runtime-core

- [ ] A simple CNN model (used for object recognition, connected to the robotic arm control)
- [ ] 2
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 4
- [ ] 5
- [ ] 6
- [ ] 7
- [ ] 8
- [ ] 9

### runtime-question

- [ ] Complete Project One
  - [x] Build a CNN model based on the CIFAR-10 training set
  - [x] The model is overly dependent on text prompts. Add noise interference to force the model to learn image features
  - [ ] The designed CNN structure is too simple, resulting in some models still being unable to learn image features
  - [ ] undetermined
